# Breast Cancer Recognition
In this project we're up to predict the situation of Patient. whether she has a breast cancer or not; she just has a benign tumor!
For this *Binary Classification* problem, We use:
* *RBF-SVM* as our model to training data.
* *PCA* for feature extraction and dimension reduction
